The particle filter provides a log-likelihood estimate that is negatively biased. Is this a consequence of:

**A**. Jensen's inequality.\
**B**. Fubini's theorem.\
**C**. Wilks' theorem.\
**D**. Chebyshev's inequality.\
**E**. Consistency of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.\
**F**. Unbiasedness of the likelihood estimate for sequential Monte Carlo.\
**G**. Two or more of the above.
