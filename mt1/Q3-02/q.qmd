The Python function `statsmodels.tsa.arima.model.ARIMA.fit` and the R function `arima()` provide standard errors calculated by observed Fisher information. This question tests your understanding of what that means. Suppose a parametric model has a single parameter, $\theta$, and the log-likelihood function when fitting this model to dataset is as follows:

```{python}
#| label: q3_02_fisher_info
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 3.25
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

theta = np.linspace(0, 10, 200)
loglik = -2000 - (theta - 5)**2

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3.5))
ax.plot(theta, loglik)
ax.set_xlabel('theta')
ax.set_ylabel('loglik')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

What is the observed Fisher information ($I_{\mathrm obs}$) for $\theta$?

Hint 1. The observed Fisher information is accumulated over the whole dataset, not calculated per observation, so we don't have to know the number of observations, $N$.

Hint 2. Observations in time series models are usually not independent, so the log-likelihood is not the sum of the log-likelihoods for each observation. Its calculation will involve consideration of the dependence, and usually the job of calculating the log-likelihood is left to a computer.

Hint 3. The usual variance estimate for the maximum likelihood estimate, $\hat\theta$, is $\var(\hat\theta) \approx 1/I_{\mathrm obs}$.

A: $I_{\mathrm obs}=2$\
B:  $I_{\mathrm obs}=1$\
C: $I_{\mathrm obs}=1/2$\
D: $I_{\mathrm obs}=1/4$\
E: None of the above
