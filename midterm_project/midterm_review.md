Within a few days of the midterm projects submission, you should expect to receive an email similar to the following. Summary points from past midterm review reports can be found from the [2021](https://ionides.github.io/531w21/midterm_project/), [2022](https://ionides.github.io/531w22/midterm_project/), [2024](https://ionides.github.io/531w24/midterm_project/) and [2025](https://ionides.github.io/531w25/midterm_project/) versions of 531. You are welcome to look at these for ideas when writing your reports.  Some sample reports from previous years are available: [sample 1](sample-mt-peer-review-w24-1.pdf), [sample 2](sample-mt-peer-review-w24-2.pdf), [sample 3](sample-mt-peer-review-w24-3.pdf). Reviews are graded according to a [posted rubric](../rubric_midterm_review.html).

Review assignments for foobar

You have been assigned the following two projects to review. 

* Review 1: Project number baz 
* Review 2: Project number qux

The project numbers correspond to the files in the class GitHub repository (https://github.com/ionides/531w26/tree/main/midterm_project). Please submit your review reports in a single pdf file on Canvas, by Friday 2/27. The reviews will not be posted publicly, and those who wrote the project should remain blind to your identity. Please do not unblind yourself, and do not question others on which reports they are reviewing. In other words, treat this process with the same respect expected of professional academic peer review. It is not a major problem if you discover who reviews your work, but the review process works well under anonymity. Each report should identify a list of strengths and weaknesses of the project, from both technical and conceptual perspectives. A priority is to find any technical or conceptual errors that substantially affect the validity of the conclusions. The qmd file and other source files are available on the class GitHub repository, and it is appropriate for your report to include comments on coding decisions and reproducibility. The expected length of each report is at least 400 words. Your report can be shorter if you find the project is so strong that there is not much criticism to find, but it is unusual that careful reading cannot find any technical weaknesses or substantial room for improvement.
