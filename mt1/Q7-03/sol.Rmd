**Solution**. D.\

First, note that C is a correct statement, though it is not a conclusion drawn from the data so it cannot be the best answer to the question.

Both A and B suppose that it would make sense to say that the time series is iid. This is wrong, as pointed out by C.

Note that some time series authors (e.g., the textbook by Huang & Petukhina, 2022) attempt to avoid this difficulty by asserting that a time series is a collection of jointly distributed random variables, which in this course we call a time series model. However, Huang & Petukhina then refer to datasets as "time series" which leads to the same inconsistency by a different route.

D explains what can be concluded by a statistical test for an iid model, no more and no less.
