**Solution**. A.\
So-called nonparametric tests always depend critically on some modeling assumption, often an assumption of independence. Nonparametric models are flexible classes of models that can be expresses via infinite-dimensional parameter spaces rather than the finite-dimensional parameter spaces of regular parametric models. Sometimes the model assumptions are not so evident, or not so well-known, for nonparametric models, but they must be there in order to obtain inferences such as p-values or posterior probabilities. This discredits answer B.

Models have many purposes, not all statistical. Simple conceptual models are widely used in science (e.g., ideal springs, biochemical interactions within a cell) but these are not usually designed to give quantitative statistical understanding of data. A statistical model is one that is developed for the purposes of statistical inferences, and the model is useful so far as those inferences are reliable and pertinent to the scientific study. This discredits answer C. Arguably, C matches exploratory statistical analysis better than confirmatory statistical analysis, but even exploratory data analysis is usually carried out with hypotheses in mind.

We are left with answer A. This is the traditional framework for the introductory theory and practice of statistics. It remains true in more complex time series situations, for which we need models describing dependence through time.
