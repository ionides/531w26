**Solution**. A.\
The log-likelihood here is a quadratic function. We can see by inspection that this quadratic is given by
$$\ell(\theta)= -2000-(\theta-5)^2.$$
The observed Fisher information is the negative of the second derivative of the log-likelihood at the MLE, so $I_{\mathrm obs}=2$. 
Thus, the standard error is $1/\sqrt{2}=0.707$
