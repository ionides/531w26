**Solution**. A.\
  All searches are finding parameters with consistent likelihood. The discrepancies of a few log likelihood units put the parameter values within statistical uncertainty according to Wilks's Theorem. Therefore, the spread in the parameter estimates reflects uncertainty about the parameter given the data, rather than a lack of convergence. 

  That perspective suggests that the goal of the Monte Carlo optimizer is to get close to the MLE, measured by likelihood, rather than to obtain it exactly. Independent Mont Carlo searches can be combined via a profile likelihood to get a more exact point estimate and a confidence interval.

  Wide confidence intervals, also called weak identifability, are not necessarily a problem for the scientific investigation. Some parameters may be imprecisely estimable, while others can be obtained more precisely, and part of the analysis is to find which is in each category. It may also be of interest to investigate what extra precision can be obtained on one parameter by making assumptions about the value of another, as in D, but this is not mandatory for proper inference.

  Overall, the convergence plots here look good. The plots show that the seaches are all started from a single high likelihood starting point. Now this has been done successfully, a natural next step would be to start some searches from more diverse starting points to look for any global features missed by this local search.
