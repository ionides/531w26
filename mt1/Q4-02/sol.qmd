**Solution**. C.\
Here's what happens when we take a `log(x+1)` transform, fitting ARMA(2,2) and checking the residuals as before.

```{python}
#| label: q4_02_log_mers
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-height: 2.5
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats
from statsmodels.tsa.arima.model import ARIMA

mers_df = pd.read_csv("data/mers.csv")
saudi = mers_df[mers_df['Region'] == 'Saudi Arabia']
mers = saudi['New.Cases'].values
year = saudi['Year'].values + (saudi['Week'].values - 1) / 52
mask = year > 2013.5
mers = mers[mask]
year = year[mask]

# Fit ARMA(2,2) to log-transformed data
log_arma22 = ARIMA(np.log(mers + 1), order=(2, 0, 2)).fit()

# Create two-panel plot
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 2.5))

# Panel A: Time series
ax1.plot(year, np.log(mers + 1), 'k-', linewidth=1)
ax1.set_xlabel('Year')
ax1.set_ylabel('log(MERS Reports+1)')
ax1.text(2012.1, 4.5, 'A', fontsize=16)

# Panel B: Q-Q plot
stats.probplot(log_arma22.resid, dist="norm", plot=ax2)
ax2.set_title('')
ax2.text(-4.2, 1.5, 'B', fontsize=16)

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

It is often a good idea to log-transform non-negative quantities, and failure to do this can show up as long tailed residuals.
Fitting long-tailed ARMA models is possible, but non-standard and not necessary here.
There is seasonality, but an ARMA(2,2) model can already explain some periodicity so including a seasonal term in the model is not critical.
There may be some non-stationarity here, but nothing that resembles the null hypothesis of the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, so that is not relevant here.
