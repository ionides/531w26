------ FULL QUIZZES ------

mt1.qmd has 3 R flags 
ALL : include all the questions in the generator
SOL : include solutions
QLABELS : include question directory labels. usually set equal to ALL

mt1.qmd also has a Latex flag
%% \newcommand\exam[1]{#1} %% exam paper formatting
\newcommand\exam[1]{} %% omit exam paper formatting

For each question x,
python generate_questions.py
does the following:
(1) it adds a line to each of the files Qx-n/q.qmd that creates a variable my_dir telling the file what directory it is in. The result is saved in Qx-n/tmp.qmd
(2) it concatenates all these files in case ALL = True
(3) if ALL = False, it instead pulls out a random question
(4) it writes tmp*.qmd for each section
Then, quarto render can be run to make the pdf

When writing questions,
(1) the file Qx-n/q.qmd should assume there is an R variable my_dir giving the name of the current directory.
(2) datasets should be in the directory Qx-n and can be accessed, e.g., by
vg <- read.table(paste(my_dir,"/vg_sales.txt",sep=""))
(3) solutions should be called Qx-n/sol.qmd or Qx-n/sol-a.qmd etc, and be referenced as follows:
```{r,child=paste(my_dir,"/sol.qmd",sep=""),eval=SOL}
```

The point of all this is that the question doesn't have to know its question number or directory name, which makes it easier to shuffle questions around without having to rename lots of internal links.
