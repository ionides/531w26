1. Multiple choice question title:
 Selecting a model for forecasting: https://ionides.github.io/531w26/quiz/class13.pdf

Question text:
The question is posted at https://ionides.github.io/531w26/quiz/class13.pdf


Answers: 

(A). AIC is based on one-step prediction, so for longer-term forecasts it is less reliable than fitting by $k$-step prediction error for $k>1$.


* (B). Leave-one-out cross-validation is not designed for dependent data.

(C). Ideally, we should use a different model for each time in the forecasting window, fitting using $k$-step prediction error when forecasting $k$ steps ahead.

(D). The model that best predicts the most recent data when fitted to earlier data (i.e, (iv)) is more reliable for subsequent forecasting than methods which evaluate based on the whole time series history (i, ii, iii).

(E). More than 1 of (A, B, C, D)
