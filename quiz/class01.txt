Multiple choice question title: The role of time series models: https://ionides.github.io/531w26/quiz/class01.pdf

Question text: The question is posted at https://ionides.github.io/531w26/quiz/class01.pdf

Answers: 

(A). A statistical inference requires a statistical model. Investigating a hypothesis via a p-value requires a model to obtain the distribution of the p-value. Investigation of Bayesian posterior probabilities requires a model.

(B). Parametric statistical tests require a model. However, where possible, we should use nonparametric methods (e.g., rank tests, or cross-validation) that do not require a model and so are more robust.

(C). Modeling is of intrinsic scientific value, as a way of understanding the data-generating mechanism. We do not have to have specific statistical tests in mind when developing a model.


2. essay question title: Supporting reasoning

Give some supporting reasoning for your answer. A sentence or two about each option would be appropriate.

For this assignment, the credit is for the showing some reasoning, not for correctness.
